# D3 Line Chart Example - Sports Career Stats

Example can be found on Codepen: [D3 Line Chart Example - Sports Career Stats](https://codepen.io/gphughes/projects/public/)

Repo used as a means to deploy code to my newly created server: [gavinhughes.us](gavinhughes.us)

An example of manipulating data from a CSV file using D3.v4, includes animation of the axis, points, and paths. I chose a hybrid between a scatter plot and line chart to visualize and communicate the data.

The Plus/Minus statistic is unique in the sense that it has negative integers and the x- and y-axis intersect at the middle of the chartArea.

Currently working on updating the axis-labels as well as implementing a corresponding tooltip, which displays the value of the data.

Used as a personal tutorial to gain familiarity with D3 after watching Shirley Wu's Front End Masters class:  [ Introduction to Data Visualization with d3.js v4](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/d3-v4/?u=4ce45e74ef4a8701eaaa4e8fb17bab705ebd772c).
